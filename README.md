## About Me

With 13+ years crafting elegant, user-centric digital experiences across diverse industries, I bring a unique combination of technical precision and design sensibility to every project. My recent work specializes in the Angular ecosystem, however I bring a strong track record of versatile expertise across multiple frontend frameworks and design tools.

My work transforms complex challenges into scalable, innovative solutions spanning healthcare systems, GPS tracking, video-based training platforms, and digital advertising. I excel in architecture design, technical leadership, and cross-functional collaboration to bring forward-thinking applications to life.

## 🧠 Professional Philosophy

- **Technical Precision Meets Design Aesthetic**: Balancing complex technical requirements with intuitive user experiences that inspire and engage.
- **Sustainable Component Architecture**: Creating reusable, maintainable systems that scale efficiently and adapt to changing needs.
- **Collective Growth Through Shared Expertise**: Fostering environments where knowledge sharing and team skill development flourish.
- **Embracing the Technological Now**: Continuous evolution - weaving timeless principles with innovative horizons.

## 🚀 My Approach to Development

1. **User-Centered Development**  
   Technical decisions should serve user needs and enhance experiences, not just solve engineering problems.

2. **Sustainable Architecture**  
   Building systems that not only work today, but can adapt to tomorrow's requirements through thoughtful component design.

3. **Continuous Learning**  
   Actively embracing new technologies while maintaining a strong foundation in fundamental principles.

4. **Collaborative Excellence**  
   Fostering environments where diverse perspectives and skills combine to create solutions greater than any individual could produce alone.

## Foundation Leadership Experience

Before focusing on engineering leadership and technical architecture, I established my leadership approach as **Worldwide Training Team & Program Manager at Microsoft (1994-1997)**, where I:

- Led a geographically distributed team of 20 professionals across the US and Europe
- Created enterprise software training and leadership development programs for Microsoft technical support and consulting teams
- Managed annual operational budgets of up to $3M for global training initiatives
- Developed methodologies that continue to influence my approach to cross-functional team leadership and technical project management
