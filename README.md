## About Me

With 13+ years crafting elegant, user-centric digital experiences across diverse industries, I bring a unique combination of technical precision and design sensibility to every project. I specialize in the Angular ecosystem while maintaining versatile expertise across multiple frontend frameworks and design tools.

My work transforms complex challenges into scalable, innovative solutions spanning healthcare systems, GPS tracking, video-based training platforms, and digital advertising. I excel in architecture design, technical leadership, and cross-functional collaboration to bring forward-thinking applications to life.

## Foundation Leadership Experience

Before focusing on engineering leadership and technical architecture, I established my leadership approach as **Worldwide Training Team & Program Manager at Microsoft (1994-1997)**, where I:

- Led a geographically distributed team of 20 professionals across the US and Europe
- Created enterprise software training and leadership development programs for Microsoft technical support and consulting teams
- Managed annual operational budgets of up to $3M for global training initiatives
- Developed methodologies that continue to influence my approach to cross-functional team leadership and technical project management
