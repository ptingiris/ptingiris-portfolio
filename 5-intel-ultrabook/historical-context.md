# Responsive Design Approach (2013)

## Historical Context

In 2013, responsive web design was still in its early adoption phase. The term had been coined by Ethan Marcotte only a few years earlier in 2010, and many commercial websites were still using separate mobile sites rather than responsive designs. The Intel Ultrabook campaign represented a forward-thinking approach by implementing responsive techniques that would later become standard practice.

## Implementation Challenges

### Limited Browser Support

In 2013, browser support for many CSS3 features was inconsistent:

- Internet Explorer 8 was still widely used and had no support for media queries
- Mobile browsers had varying levels of support for CSS3 properties
- Vendor prefixes were necessary for many CSS properties

### Device Diversity

The device landscape was very different:
- iPhone 5 had just been released with a 4-inch screen
- Android fragmentation was a major issue with widely varying screen sizes
- Tablets were relatively new in the mainstream market
- High-DPI displays were just beginning to appear

## Responsive Techniques Used

### Media Queries

The project used media queries to adapt layouts for different screen sizes:

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    font-size: 30%;
  }
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 780px) {
  body {
    font-size: 40%;
  }
}
```

### Fluid Layouts

The design used percentage-based widths to create flexible layouts:

```css
#trmContainer {
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 100%; 
  max-width: 800px;
  text-align: left;
}

#trmContainer #content {
  min-height: 100em;
}
```

### Flexible Images

Images were made responsive through CSS:

```css
#trmContainer #povContainer .pov img {
  width: 100%; 
  max-width: 800px;
}
```

### Relative Units

The project used relative units for typography:

```css
#trmContainer #povContainer .views p {
  font-size: 1.33em;
  line-height: 1.55;
}
```

## Browser Detection and Feature Support

The project implemented feature detection to handle different browser capabilities:

```javascript
function iefix() {
  var ua = navigator.userAgent.match('MSIE');
  var version = ua !== null ? parseInt(navigator.userAgent.split('MSIE')[1].slice(1)) : null;
  
  if (ua !== null) {
    $('#trmContainer').addClass('MSIE');
    
    if (version < 9) {
      $('#trmContainer').addClass('ie' + version);
      
      // Additional IE-specific adjustments
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Responsive Navigation

The navigation was designed to adapt to different screen sizes:

```css
#trmContainer #povContainer nav li {
  float: left;
  text-align: center;
  width: 25%;
}

#trmContainer #povContainer nav a {
  display: block;
  height: 45px; 
  line-height: 45px;
}
```

## Mobile-First Considerations

While not fully implementing mobile-first (which would become more standard in later years), the project did consider mobile devices:

```css
/* Base styles that work for all devices */
html, body {
  font-size: 13px;
  line-height: 1;
}

/* Adjustments for smaller screens */
@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    font-size: 30%;
  }
}
```

## Fallback Strategies

For browsers that didn't support responsive features, fallbacks were provided:

```css
#trmContainer.ie8 #povContainer .pov {
  border: none;
}

#trmContainer.ie8 #povContainer .pov .bg-image {
  display: inline;
}

#trmContainer.ie7 {
  margin-top: 0;
  width: auto;
}
```

## Performance Considerations

The responsive design included performance optimizations:

- Images were appropriately sized with max-width constraints
- JavaScript was used sparingly for essential interactions
- CSS was structured to minimize repaints and reflows

## How This Approach Was Forward-Thinking

The responsive techniques used in this 2013 project anticipated several developments that would become standard practice:

1. **Fluid Grid Systems**: The percentage-based layout approach anticipated the grid systems that frameworks like Bootstrap would popularize.

2. **Progressive Enhancement**: The project used feature detection and fallbacks, which became a cornerstone of modern web development.

3. **Responsive Images**: The project's approach to flexible images preceded the `picture` element and `srcset` attribute that were introduced later.

4. **Relative Typography**: Using relative units for typography is now considered best practice.

5. **Breakpoint Strategy**: The project used breakpoints based on content needs rather than specific devices, which has become the recommended approach.

## Lessons for Modern Development

When viewed in its historical context, this project offers several insights that remain relevant:

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality that works everywhere, then enhance for capable browsers.

2. **Feature Detection**: Test for feature support rather than making assumptions based on browser versions.

3. **Content-First Design**: Design decisions should be driven by content needs, not specific devices.

4. **Performance Matters**: Consider the performance implications of responsive techniques, especially for users on slower connections.

## Conclusion

The responsive design approach used in the 2013 Intel Ultrabook campaign demonstrated forward-thinking application of web standards that were still emerging at the time. By implementing fluid layouts, flexible images, and media queries with appropriate fallbacks, the project delivered a consistent experience across the diverse device landscape of 2013.

This approach laid the foundation for the more sophisticated responsive techniques that would become standard in the years that followed, showing how thoughtful implementation of emerging standards can create lasting, resilient web experiences.
