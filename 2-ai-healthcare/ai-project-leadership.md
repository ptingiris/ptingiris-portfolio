# AI Project Leadership
## Turning Around a Stalled LLM Implementation

This case study examines how I successfully turned around a troubled healthcare AI integration project that was six months behind schedule, transforming it into a successful delivery that exceeded business expectations.

## Project Context

### Initial Situation
When I took over the AI-Powered Letters of Medical Necessity project, it was facing significant challenges:

- **Six months behind schedule** with no clear path to completion
- **Team morale was low** after multiple failed implementation attempts
- **Stakeholder confidence had eroded** due to missed deadlines
- **Technical direction was unclear** with competing approaches under consideration
- **HIPAA compliance requirements** had not been adequately addressed

### Business Criticality
The feature was strategically important to the organization:

- Represented a key competitive advantage in the healthcare documentation space
- Was already being marketed to customers despite not being ready
- Would significantly reduce administrative burden for healthcare practitioners
- Had potential to improve patient care by freeing up clinical time

## Leadership Methodology

I implemented a structured yet adaptive leadership approach tailored to the specific challenges of the project:

### 1. Comprehensive Assessment Phase (Week 1-2)

Rather than rushing into solutions, I began with a thorough assessment:

- **Conducted individual interviews** with each team member to understand perspectives and concerns
- **Analyzed previous implementation attempts** to identify patterns of failure
- **Reviewed all technical documentation** and architecture proposals
- **Evaluated stakeholder expectations** and business requirements
- **Assessed compliance requirements** and potential gaps

This assessment revealed several critical insights:
- The contracted LLM provider lacked required HIPAA compliance documentation
- The team had been operating without clear architecture diagrams
- Several team members had valuable insights that weren't being heard
- The project scope had been growing without corresponding timeline adjustments

### 2. Strategic Rebaseline (Week 2-3)

With a clear understanding of the current state, I worked with stakeholders to:

- **Redefine the minimum viable product** with clear, prioritized requirements
- **Create a realistic timeline** that accounted for technical challenges
- **Establish risk management protocols** with weekly review sessions
- **Define clear roles and responsibilities** for each team member
- **Implement a transparent communication plan** for stakeholders

### 3. Architectural Reset (Week 3-4)

Instead of dictating solutions, I facilitated a collaborative architecture process:

- **Organized a two-day architecture workshop** where the team could collaboratively design solutions
- **Implemented a "diagram-first" approach** where all technical decisions were visualized
- **Created architecture decision records (ADRs)** to document key technical choices and their rationale
- **Established technical boundaries and interfaces** between system components
- **Developed a compliance strategy** to address the HIPAA requirements

### 4. Agile Implementation with Clear Milestones (Week 4-16)

With renewed clarity, we implemented a tailored development approach:

- **Two-week sprints** with clearly defined outcomes
- **Daily stand-ups** focused on blockers and solutions
- **Bi-weekly demonstrations** to stakeholders showing tangible progress
- **Weekly risk review sessions** to proactively address challenges
- **Dedicated "solution sessions"** for addressing technical hurdles

### 5. Situational Leadership Model

Throughout the project, I adapted my leadership style based on the team's evolving needs:

- **Directive leadership** when clear guidance was needed on regulatory compliance
- **Coaching approach** when team members were developing new skills
- **Supportive style** during high-stress integration testing periods
- **Delegating responsibility** to team members in their areas of expertise

This flexibility allowed team members to grow while ensuring the project maintained momentum.

## Critical Leadership Decisions

Several key decisions proved pivotal to the project's success:

### 1. In-house LLM Development

When we discovered our contracted LLM provider couldn't meet HIPAA requirements, I made the decision to:
- Pivot to an in-house LLM implementation rather than search for a new vendor
- Reallocate budget from the vendor contract to additional engineering resources
- Expedite compliance review processes by involving legal counsel early

This decision increased short-term workload but eliminated a critical project risk.

### 2. Team Restructuring

Based on individual interviews and observed dynamics, I implemented subtle but important team changes:
- Paired complementary skill sets to accelerate knowledge transfer
- Created specialized working groups for authentication, AI processing, and UX design
- Established rotating technical lead roles based on the sprint's focus

### 3. Stakeholder Management Strategy

I implemented a tiered communication approach:
- Weekly executive summaries highlighting progress and risk mitigation
- Bi-weekly demonstrations showing tangible progress
- Monthly strategic reviews aligning the project with evolving business needs
- Just-in-time updates on critical issues or decisions requiring input

This approach rebuilt trust while minimizing disruption to the team.

## Challenges Overcome

### 1. Resistance to Architecture Changes

**Challenge:** Some team members were invested in previous approaches and resistant to changes.

**Solution:** Rather than mandating new approaches, I facilitated collaborative design sessions where team members could propose and evaluate alternatives. This created buy-in while still moving toward more effective technical solutions.

### 2. Technical Skill Gaps

**Challenge:** The team had varying levels of experience with AI integration.

**Solution:** I implemented targeted pair programming sessions and dedicated learning time, allowing more experienced team members to mentor others while working on actual project tasks.

### 3. Scope Expansion Requests

**Challenge:** Stakeholders continued to request additional features that threatened the timeline.

**Solution:** I developed a transparent prioritization framework that illustrated trade-offs between features, quality, and timeline. This helped stakeholders make informed decisions about what to include in the initial release.

### 4. Integration Testing Complexity

**Challenge:** Testing the full AI workflow across multiple systems proved exceptionally complex.

**Solution:** I advocated for and implemented a dedicated testing environment with comprehensive test data and scenarios, enabling thorough integration testing without impacting development velocity.

## Quantifiable Outcomes

The leadership approach yielded impressive results:

- **Timeline Recovery:** Delivered the feature a month ahead of the revised schedule
- **Test Coverage:** Achieved over 90% test coverage, substantially reducing post-release issues
- **Team Growth:** Three team members were promoted following the project based on skills they developed
- **Business Impact:** The feature exceeded revenue projections by 15% in the first quarter
- **Technical Quality:** Architecture established became the model for future AI integrations
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Post-project survey showed 95% satisfaction with the delivery process

## Leadership Lessons

This project reinforced several key leadership principles:

1. **Transparency builds trust** - Open communication about challenges and constraints created stronger stakeholder relationships.

2. **Collaboration enhances solutions** - The team produced better technical solutions when everyone's expertise was valued and incorporated.

3. **Situational leadership drives results** - Adapting leadership style to the needs of the moment helped maintain momentum through different project phases.

4. **Process serves people** - Tailoring methodologies to the team's needs rather than rigidly applying frameworks enhanced productivity and morale.

5. **Visualize everything** - Architecture diagrams, process flows, and decision trees improved clarity and alignment across the team.

## Conclusion

The turnaround of the AI-Powered Letters of Medical Necessity project exemplifies how thoughtful leadership can transform a troubled initiative. By establishing clear direction, fostering collaboration, and implementing structured yet flexible processes, we overcame significant challenges to deliver a feature that exceeded business expectations and created value for healthcare practitioners and patients alike.
