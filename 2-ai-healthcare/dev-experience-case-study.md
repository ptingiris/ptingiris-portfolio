# Developer Experience Transformation: Rescuing a Healthcare SaaS Project with Process Engineering

## Executive Summary

This case study documents how I led a critical, CEO-sponsored initiative to transform the developer experience and rescue a stalled healthcare SaaS project. By orchestrating a comprehensive 2-week development process retreat, I guided a team of 14 developers in reimagining their entire workflow—from git branching strategies to CI/CD pipelines to AI-enhanced testing. The result was a successful on-time delivery of a previously stalled AI integration project, dramatically improved code quality, and enhanced team morale.

## The Challenge

When I joined the project, the organization was facing a perfect storm of development problems:

### Team Challenges
- **Critical Retention Issues**: Lost 5 senior developers within 6 months
- **Severe Morale Problems**: Developers were siloed, frustrated, and afraid to speak up
- **Leadership Gap**: CTO and several senior developers had left or been fired

### Technical Challenges
- **Unmanageable Technical Debt**: 
  - 90% of code lacked tests or documentation
  - Hundreds of unorganized bugs and support tickets
  - Daily production issues

### Process Challenges
- **Inefficient Development Workflow**: 
  - 90% of time spent on manual deployments or fixing deployment-related issues
  - No structured git branching strategy
  - No code review process
  - Inconsistent processes between teams

### Strategic Challenges
- **Stalled V2 Implementation**: Only 20% complete after 3 years
  - Application was split between legacy AngularJS and new Angular 14 frontend
  - Shared MySQL database but siloed development teams
  - All feature deliveries consistently delayed
  - Customer and employee attrition due to quality issues

This perfect storm of issues had escalated to the point of requiring CEO intervention, resulting in my leadership of a comprehensive turnaround effort.

## The Approach

Recognizing that both technical and cultural changes were needed, I designed and led a CEO-approved 2-week immersive development process retreat—the first of its kind in the company's history.

### Retreat Structure
- **Daily All-Team Sessions**: 2-hour sessions focused on improving communication and morale
- **Task Force Formation**: Facilitated the creation of 4 self-selected working groups
- **Developer Empowerment**: Each developer joined 2 task forces, with daily 1-hour meetings
- **Facilitation Methods**: Employed retrospectives, root cause analysis, and consensus building

### Key Focus Areas
1. **Git Workflow Redesign**: Created a structured branching strategy with clear paths and naming conventions
2. **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**: Introduced automation through Bitbucket Pipelines
3. **Code Quality Improvements**: Integrated AI-powered tools including CodeCov and Testomat.io
4. **Process Standardization**: Developed a custom hybrid framework tailored to the team's needs

## Technical Implementation

### Git Branching Strategy Transformation
Created a comprehensive git workflow that addressed the previous ad-hoc approach:
- **Structured Branch Types**: Main, version, feature/bugfix branches with clear naming conventions
- **Environment Management**: Dedicated test_live environment with formal validation paths
- **Quality Gates**: Implemented testing checkpoints before code could progress
- **Release Process**: Formalized staging validation and release procedures

### CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- **Platform Selection**: Implemented Bitbucket Pipelines for build automation
- **Code Review Enforcement**: Configured minimum of 2 developer reviews before merging
- **Testing Integration**: Automated test execution as part of the pipeline

### AI-Enhanced Quality Tools
- **CodeCov Integration**: Connected to Bitbucket pipelines for test coverage monitoring
- **Testomat.io Implementation**: Integrated with Jira for comprehensive test management
- **Documentation Approach**: Identified (though unable to fully implement) AI-assisted documentation generation

### Custom Development Framework
Designed and implemented a structured approach:
- **PLAN**: PM-driven assessment, requirements, designs, timeline
- **BUILD**: Development phase with clear deliverables 
- **TEST**: QA-focused validation process
- **RELEASE**: Customer Success-supported deployment

## Results

The process transformation yielded significant measurable improvements:

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Increased from 10% to 90% in AI projects under my leadership
- **Production Issues**: Zero post-release bugs for the AI features I managed
- **Build Times**: Notable decreases in build duration (though not specifically quantified)

### Team Impact
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Very high feedback on new processes
- **Collaboration**: Improved cross-team communication and reduced silos
- **Process Adoption**: Successfully implemented standardized development practices where none existed before

### Business Outcomes
- **Project Delivery**: Un-stalled the previously delayed AI project, delivering a month ahead of schedule
- **Feature Completion**: Successfully delivered the Letter of Medical Necessity AI feature
- **Process Foundation**: Established groundwork for ongoing developer experience improvements

## Key Learnings & Insights

This transformation effort revealed several critical insights:

1. **Leadership Support is Fundamental**: The CEO's sponsorship of a 2-week immersive retreat was essential for making substantial change.

2. **Developer Input Drives Adoption**: Self-selected task forces and consensus-building increased ownership of the new processes.

3. **Process Before Tools**: Establishing clear workflows and expectations was more important than the specific tooling.

4. **AI Integration Has Two Faces**: While leadership focused on customer-facing AI features, I identified opportunities for AI-enhanced developer workflows that could dramatically improve productivity.

5. **Technical Debt Requires Structural Solutions**: The issues stemmed from a lack of process foundation, not just coding practices.

## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates my ability to lead complex developer experience transformations in challenging environments. By addressing the fundamental workflow issues through a structured yet collaborative approach, I was able to rescue a stalled project, improve code quality, and establish sustainable processes for the development team.

The strategic implementation of improved git workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and AI-enhanced testing tools directly addressed the root causes of the previous challenges, enabling successful project delivery and improving both developer satisfaction and code quality metrics.

This experience directly relates to the Engineering Manager, Developer Experience role, where similar skills in process optimization, CI/CD implementation, and team leadership would be essential for success.
