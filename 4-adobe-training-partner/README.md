## Project Overview
In 2015, I developed a custom online training platform for Kelby Media Group, Adobe's official training partner for photography and Lightroom education. This specialized platform required building an advanced video player with integrated learning features to deliver premium educational content to creative professionals worldwide.

## Key Achievements
- Created a specialized video player by extending the jwPlayer API with educational features
- Developed a structured framework for organizing multi-part video courses
- Implemented systems to track and save user progress through course materials
- Built specialized content display for Lightroom presets and photography techniques
- Designed a fully responsive interface that maintained optimal viewing across devices

## Technical Implementation
Working collaboratively with Kelby Media's content team, I created a robust platform with these key technical elements:

- **Custom Video Player**: Integrated and extended the jwPlayer API to create a specialized educational video experience
- **Course Management System**: Developed a structured framework for organizing multi-part video courses
- **Responsive Design**: Built a fully responsive interface that maintained optimal video viewing experiences across devices
- **User Progress Tracking**: Implemented systems to track and save user progress through course materials
- **Integration with Lightroom**: Created specialized content display for Lightroom presets and photography techniques

## Technical Challenges Overcome

### Educational Video Experience
Standard video players lacked features necessary for educational content. I enhanced the jwPlayer API with custom controls for:
- Chapter navigation
- Playback speed control (essential for technique demonstrations)
- Transcript synchronization
- Note-taking capabilities while watching

### Performance Optimization
Photography training requires high-quality video to showcase details, yet needed to perform well across various connection speeds and devices:
- Implemented adaptive streaming solutions
- Created thumbnail preview systems for navigation
- Optimized video loading for seamless transitions between lessons

### Complex Content Organization
Professional photography courses often include supplementary materials beyond video:
- Built a system to associate downloadable resources with specific timestamps
- Created a framework for integrating Lightroom presets with related tutorials
- Implemented tagging and cross-referencing between related content

## User Experience Focus

The project required careful attention to the learning experience:

1. **Distraction-Free Learning**: Designed a UI that kept the focus on educational content
    - Minimalist player controls that appeared when needed
    - Clean typography for readability of supplementary materials
    - Thoughtful use of whitespace to create visual hierarchy

2. **Learning Path Design**: Created intuitive navigation between course modules
    - Visual progress indicators
    - Clear pathways between related content
    - "Next Recommended" suggestions based on course structure

3. **Photographer-Centric Details**: Added features specifically valuable to photographers
    - Color-accurate video playback
    - High-resolution screenshot capabilities for technique demonstration
    - Integration with photography workflow tools

## Impact & Evolution

This project represented a significant step in my development approach:

- **Content-First Development**: Working with educational content required putting user learning needs at the center of technical decisions

- **API Extension Skills**: The custom video player work demonstrated my ability to take existing tools and extend them for specialized purposes

- **Integration Expertise**: Building connections between the video platform and external tools like Lightroom showcased integration skills

- **User Experience Focus**: This project deepened my understanding of how technical decisions impact the overall user experience

## Technology Stack

- **Front-End**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery
- **Video**: jwPlayer API with custom extensions
- **Responsive Design**: Custom CSS framework
- **User Data**: AJAX for progress saving and retrieval
- **Media Management**: Custom integration with content delivery networks
